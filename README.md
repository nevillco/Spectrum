# Spectrum

The Spectrum Game is a simple iOS game that tests the user's ability to guess a color via its RGB values. A previous version is currently  in the App Store. This new version will feature:

* Entirely programmatic views and better MVC structure
* A global leaderboard using a Parse database
* A more user-friendly and better looking UI
* Bonus score multipliers
* Prevent users from leaving the app to examine the color by properly utilizing the background state

Down-the-line changes (nice things to work on, but not immediate goals):

* Try converting `constraintWithItem`s to `constraintWithVisualFormat`
* Use CoreGraphics to draw additional randomly-generated "color blots" on the view
* Option to hide instructions for more screen space

along with any other features I think of along the way. For any inquiries/suggestions/comments about the project, feel free to email me at nevillco@bc.edu.
